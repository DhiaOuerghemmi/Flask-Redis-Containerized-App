## Problem Statement

Web applications today demand highly available, scalable session management. Traditional session storage (like file-based sessions) can lead to performance bottlenecks and are difficult to scale horizontally across multiple instances. Additionally, setting up environments manually is tedious and error-prone, often leading to inconsistencies between development, staging, and production.

---

## Solution Overview

This project addresses these challenges by:
- Building a lightweight **Flask web app** that stores user sessions in **Redis**, enabling fast, scalable session management.
- Containerizing the entire stack (Flask, Redis, Nginx) with **Docker** for consistent environments.
- Managing multi-container orchestration with **Docker Compose**.
- Using **GitHub Actions** for a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub automatically.

---

## Features

✅ Stateless, scalable Flask app with Redis-backed sessions  
✅ Multi-container Docker Compose setup (Flask app, Redis, Nginx reverse proxy)  
✅ Secure, environment-variable-based configuration management  
✅ Production-ready Dockerfiles for each service  
✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions: build, test, and deploy  
✅ Ready-to-use local development and production profiles

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
- GitHub account (for CI/CD)
- Docker Hub account (optional for publishing)

---

## Installation & Setup

Step-by-step setup guide available in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-redis-docker-app.git
cd flask-redis-docker-app
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

Visit your app at `http://localhost`.

---

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables:

Example `.env`:

```dotenv
FLASK_ENV=development
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=supersecretkey
```

Override values as needed for staging/production environments.

---

## Usage

To bring the stack up:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To bring it down:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Full CLI examples, login session demo, and Redis inspection commands are in [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD:

- Lint and test Flask code
- Build Docker images
- Push images to Docker Hub
- Trigger deployments (optional)

Workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Example build badge:

![CI/CD](https://github.com/your-username/flask-redis-docker-app/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are covered in [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

Example:

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Cannot connect to Redis` | Check that Redis container is healthy and reachable at `redis:6379` |
| `Docker-compose fails` | Ensure Docker Compose version is compatible (≥2.x) |
